# 📊 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Elevate AI/ML Internship

## 🧠 Objective
Explore and understand the Titanic dataset using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

---

## 📁 Dataset Used
- **Name**: Titanic Dataset  
- **Source**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset]
- (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 🔎 EDA Steps

### 1. Summary Statistics
- Used `.describe()` to compute mean, median, std, etc.

### 2. Visualizations
- **Histograms**: Distribution of `Age`, `Fare`, etc.
- **Boxplots**: Outlier detection in numeric columns.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Relationship between numeric features.
- **Pairplot**: Feature relationships based on survival.
- **Countplots**: Categorical variables like `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Survived`.

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- Females had a higher survival rate.
- Passengers in **1st class** had better survival chances.
- Fare and Age distributions were skewed and had outliers.
